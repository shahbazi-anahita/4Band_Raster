# 4Band_Raster
This function gets a hyperspectral raster, searches for four specific band wavelengths and outputs a raster of those four spectral bands with the same file format as the input. The default spectral wavelengths is [440, 540, 640, 840] nm which corresponds to the Blue, Green, Red and Near Infrared parts of spectrum.
